This visual compares the GDP of the United States and the Number of medals obtained in the Summer Olympics over the years 1960-2012. We see a correlation between the two values. We also see that the rate of increase of sports events, is much larger than both the other two curves, showing that the increase of medals is not just caused by a larger number of events.
